### Key Questions

The urban heat island (UHI) effect results in the warming of cities due to reduced vegetation, with neighborhoods lacking green space being most vulnerable to this effect. This analysis investigates:

1.  **Which neighborhoods in Vancouver are the greenest?**
2.  **What is the relationship between income and vegetation density in the Greater Vancouver Area?**

### Data Sources and Tools

To explore these questions, I used: - **Sentinel-2 satellite data** to analyze vegetation density. - **Statistics Canada census data** to examine income distribution. - **Python** for data processing and transformation. - **Power BI** for creating an interactive data visualization dashboard.
